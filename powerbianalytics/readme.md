## Introduction
<p>The main goal of this project is to use Microsoft Power BI data analytics software to create project dashboards from the scratch.</p>

<p>In order to use the power BI desktop version, I downloaded it from Microsoft website at https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/ and you can download it for free. </p>

The current version (Version: 2.96.701.0 64-bit (August 2021)) has a nice feature of 'Get data' and I can use any connector to bring in different type of data here. I have chosen a demo data in the csv format for this project and as it starts loading, it shows the data along with its' data types.
