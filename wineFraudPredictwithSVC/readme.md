Frauds in the wine industry are very real? You may be wondering if I can share any proof of that. Here are some links for you to read more about it:

    https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/11/the-great-wine-fraud-a-vintage-swindle
    https://daily.sevenfifty.com/beyond-high-profile-scandals-wine-fraud-is-rampant/

I think you got the idea. The next natural question may be what type of frauds in the wine industry are there?

As per Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_fraud), the most common one is where wines are adulterated with inferior ones and sold as premium ones. Relabeling is another one and there are scams related to wine investments.

The main goal of this supervised machine learning project is to use Support Vector Machine Classification algorithm to predict if a wine is 'legit' or a 'fraudulent' one based on it's chemical composition.
