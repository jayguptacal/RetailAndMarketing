As per Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate), the customer churn rate means number of subscribers leaving a service provider or supplier during a given time period. This is also known as customer attrition or customer turnover or customer defection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition). In a simpler terms, this is simply loss of customers to a business. This is an industry-wide problem more prominent in certain segments such as telecom, entertainment industry etc but most of the service providers are dealing with this problem all the time.

In order to find a proactive way, many scientists and experts are working on various machine learning models to keep fine tuning their models so that they can proactively predict the customer attrition. If the service provider can get the signal ahead of time, they can put up the necessary plans to reduce the churn rate.

**The goal of this project is to try different machine learning algorithms and see which one fits the best.**

This project has been divided into 3 Jupyter Notebooks as per following:

- First Jupyter Notebook: Full step-by-step EDA, Pre-Processing and Maachine Learning modeling covering Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and Support Vector Classifier without any type of data balancing and with default hyperparameters.

- Second Jupyter Notebook: Focused on data balancing i.e. oversampling, undersampling and SMOTE and then running those algorithms with default hyperparameters, which performed better in the first Jupyter Notebook

- Third Jupyter Notebook: Focused on the finally selected machine learning algorithms and improving the models with hyperparameter tuning
