## Introduction
<p>The main goal of this project is to use Tibco Spotfire data analytics software to create a dashboard from the scratch including downloading the trial version and installing it and then creating the project dashboard without using any templates.</p>

<p>It's really easy to download the trial version which is good for 30 days. Here is the link for those who want to download it: https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire and the best part is that it does not need your credit card so there is no risk of getting charged. </p>

The best part of Tibco Spotfire data import user interface is that you can change the data type, you can select what you want and what you don't want in terms of columns, it also recognizes the data type and you can change it in case you need to. This is an excellent interface.
